                Hey there Bhawna! I‚Äôm not the most experienced developer yet, but I‚Äôve poured a lot of time and care into creating this website
                just for you. Every line of code, every little detail, reflects how much I admire you and the effort I‚Äôm putting into
                learning and improving. It took me almost 5 days to build this, and while I‚Äôm still working on adding a backend,
                I‚Äôve included a form with a few simple questions. Your answers would mean so much to me and help me get 
                to know you better. 
                We haven‚Äôt had the chance to spend much time together yet, but I really hope we can meet soon, whether on campus or elsewhere. 
                I‚Äôd love to meet you and connect more and get to know you.
                Thank you for visiting this page and reading this‚Äîit truly means the world to me. üíñ
            </p>
