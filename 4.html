                    I‚Äôm not sure where to begin, but I‚Äôll do my best to express what‚Äôs been on my heart.

                    From the very first moment I met you, even though it was brief, you‚Äôve been in my thoughts more than anything else. There‚Äôs something about you that has stayed with me, and I find myself thinking about you often.
                    
                    I‚Äôve wanted to share how I feel, but I didn‚Äôt know how to put it into words. So, I decided to create this website as a way to express something I‚Äôve kept inside for quite some time. You‚Äôve inspired me in more ways than you might even realize, and that‚Äôs something I feel deeply grateful for.
                    
                    I don‚Äôt expect anything in return, but there‚Äôs one thing I wanted to say to you:
                    You are someone incredibly special to me, and I would love the chance to get to know you better.
                    
                    If nothing else, I truly hope this brings a smile to your face.  </font>
